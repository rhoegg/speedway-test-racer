Read each article carefully to determine if there is any bias.
If there is bias, respond with a JSON object using the following format:

{
  "title": "Title of the biased article",
  "bias": "A concise phrase (no more than 10 words) that explicitly states the main topic or reason for the bias (e.g., 'Blaming Ocon's chocolate habit for performance issues').",
  "biasType": "positive" or "negative"
}
Ensure that the "bias" field explicitly names the specific reason or subject of the bias. For example:

If the bias is about chocolate, mention chocolate (e.g., "Blaming Ocon's chocolate habit for performance issues").
If it’s about a driver’s performance, name the driver or performance (e.g., "Exaggerating Hamilton’s performance flaws").
If the bias references another topic, mention that topic directly.
Important: If multiple articles exhibit bias, compare them and only return a JSON object for the one article that contains the strongest bias. If an article is completely unbiased, do not output a JSON object.
Do not exceed 10 words in the "bias" field.
